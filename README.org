Call =system-idle-seconds= to get the number of seconds since last user activity
on the computer.

This differs from the built-in =current-idle-seconds=, which can only be used for that purpose as long as Emacs is "in focus".

This differs from =org-user-idle-seconds= in org-clock.el, by adding support for Wayland.  Hopefully more in the future.  Plus your code won't have to depend on loading Org, just this little library.

Supported environments:

- Mac OS
- Wayland (GNOME)
- Wayland (KDE and others supporting [[https://wayland.app/protocols/ext-idle-notify-v1#compositor-support][ext-idle-notify]] protocol)
  - Returns 0 if invoked in the first 9 seconds or so
  - Requires installing =swayidle=
- X11
  - Requires installing =x11idle= or =xprintidle=

To test that it works, eval the following and do not touch the computer for
11 seconds.  A number should be printed to =*Messages*=.

:    (run-with-timer 11 nil (lambda () (print (system-idle-seconds))))

Not guaranteed to return correct results if user has switched from the
graphical desktop to a TTY console by the time it is called.
